                <p>My name is Olivier Lauzon, but most people call me <em>Ollie</em>. I was born in Cornwall and moved to a few different places as a child but spent most of my childhood and young teen years in Cornwall. I moved up to Ottawa when I started high school due to my dad getting a new job here. </p>
                
                <p>My hobbies usually revolve around Japan, anime and manga but I also enjoy

                I have a passion for <dfn><abbr title="Celluloid Vintage Photography">Film Photography</abbr></dfn> as well as the psychology/ analysis of cinema and movies. I previously took Music, Media and Film foundations; my favorite classes were post-production audio and video as well as storytelling.</p>
